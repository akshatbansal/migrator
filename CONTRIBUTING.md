# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Atom and its packages, which are hosted in the [Atom Organization](https://github.com/atom) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

Read [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contribution. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How can I contribute?

Every help is appreciated. It does not matter if it's bug report or full feature contribution with code. Everything is equaly important. To find out what kind of contribution you want to do try to answer these question. 

* [I found a bug and I want to report if](#bug-reporting)
* [I have an idea how to improve application](#feature-suggestion)
* [I want to improve documentation](#documentation-impovement)
* [I want to code](#code)

### Bug reporting

To submit a bug report just open new issue and select `bug report`. Fill in the text and submit the form. That is it. I will try to respond as soon as possible.

### Feature suggestion

To submit a feature suggestion just open new issue and select `feature request`. Fill in the text and submit the form. We might need to specify some details, before this feature will be marked as ready to implement.

### Documentation impovement

To enhance the documentation, just clone the repository and update anything in documentation. By documentation I mean `README`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` and `CONTRIBUTING` markdown files. When you are finnished with your changes, create new branch `doc/...` and create pull request.

### Code

First of all you have to find something to code. Go to issues section and filter all issues that are labeled `ready`. These issues are ready to be implemented. If you want to code something that is not in the issues list, then create new [feature request](#feature-suggestion) or [bug report](#bug-reporting). By discusing features in issues section we can prevent writing code that will never be merged.

If you don't have much experiences with development, try issues that are labeled `easy`.

> I am not going to forbid you from coding whatever you want, but everything has to be reviewed before merging. Pull requests that won't have issue assigned will be probably dismised or delayed.

When you find a suitable issue for you, then clone the repository create new branch and start coding. When you are finnished create pull request. When pull request is reviewed it will be merged and deployed.

> You can create pull request sonner if you need to discus something during coding process

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/pipan/migrator/fork>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/fooBar`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
